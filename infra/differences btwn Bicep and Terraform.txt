I've successfully created equivalent Terraform files for your Bicep configuration. Here's what was created:

  Files created:
  1. variables.tf - Defines input variables
  2. main.tf - Contains all resource definitions
  3. outputs.tf - Defines output values

  Key differences from Bicep:
  - Uses random_string resource instead of uniqueString() function
  - Requires explicit resource_group_name variable since Terraform doesn't have targetScope
  - Storage connection strings use hardcoded core.windows.net endpoint suffix
  - Uses azurerm_windows_function_app resource for Function App
  - Role assignments are separate resources instead of nested properties
